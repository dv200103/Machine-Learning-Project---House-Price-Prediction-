<strong>Aim:</strong> 
</h3>

 To build a machine learning model which predict the house price accurately for the real estate agent.

**Problem Statement:**
 
 A real state agents want the help to predict the house price for regions in the USA. He gave you the dataset to work on and the task is to create a model which will help him to 
 estimate of what the house would sell for.

**Description:**
    
 Dataset contains 7 columns and 5000 rows with CSV extension. The data contains the following columns :

    'Avg. Area Income': Avg. Income of householder of the city house is located in.
    'Avg. Area House Age': Avg. Age of Houses in same city.
    'Avg. Area Number of Rooms': Avg. Number of Rooms for Houses in same city.
    'Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms': Avg. Number of Bedrooms for Houses in same city.
    'Area Population': Population of city.
    'Price': Price that the house sold at.
    'Address': Address of the houses.

  **Methods/steps:**
    
    1) Define the Problem(Problem Statement: Regression)
    
    2) Data Loading
    
    3) Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) 
       
        a) Identification of variables and data types

        b) Analyzing the basic metrics

        c) Non-Graphical Univariate Analysis

        d) Graphical Univariate Analysis

        e) Bivariate Analysis(Correlation Analysis)

        f) Variable transformations

        g) Missing value treatment

        h) Outlier treatment
        
    4) Data Preprocessing
    
        a) Feature Scaling
        
    5) Seperation of x and y 
    
    6) Train Test Split
    
    7) Choose a Model
    
    8) Train the Model
    
    9) Evaluate the Model
    
    10) Iterate and HyperTunning

**Conclusion:**
 
 We will use linear model becuase it has the maximum accuracy(91.03%) and it is also good fit.
